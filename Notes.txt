JavaScript
-------------------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web.

JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS.

JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.

HTML to define the content of web pages

CSS to specify the layout of web pages ---- Cascading stylesheet

JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

Bootstrap - Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework primarily used for building responsive and visually 
appealing websites and web applications. It was originally developed by Twitter and has since become one of the most widely used 
front-end frameworks for web development.

DOM
---------------------------------------------------------
The DOM serves as an intermediary between the web page's content and the programming language being used (usually JavaScript).
The DOM is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web pages
Document: In the context of the DOM, a "document" refers to an HTML or XML document that makes up a web page
Object: In programming, an "object" is a self-contained unit that holds data (properties) and can have associated behaviors (methods). 
Model: The "model" aspect of the DOM represents how the document is structured and how its elements relate to each other 
HTML
--------------------------------------
HTML is essential for building the structure and content of a web page.
HTML is a markup language for structuring content on web pages, while React is a JavaScript library used to 
build dynamic and interactive user interfaces

Argument and Parameter
----------------------
Parameter: A variable defined in the function, like a "slot" where the function expects to receive specific information.
Argument: The actual data you provide to the function when you use it. It's like the real "stuff" that goes into those slots.
name is a parameter of the greet function. It's like a placeholder for the actual name you want to greet.
When you call the greet function with greet("Alice"), "Alice" is the argument you're providing. It's the actual value that will
fill the name parameter.

JSON object
----------------
A JSON object, short for "JavaScript Object Notation" object, is a data structure used to represent and store 
data in a structured and easy-to-read format. JSON is commonly used for exchanging data between a server and a 
web application, as well as for configuration files and data storage.

JSON objects are often compared to JavaScript objects because they share a similar structure, but JSON is a language-independent 
data format. JSON objects are composed of key-value pairs, where each key is a string, and the corresponding value can be of various 
data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, or other JSON objects.
