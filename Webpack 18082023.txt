Webpack : A webpack is a process of creating a front end bundle which contains all HTML,CSS and JS files which is
compiled and bundled with the library. In the webpack, only the components will be added and the rest will be eliminated.
Hence only necessary library will be added and the size of the webpack will become less after compilation. In order to create a webpack
we need compilers and then we need webpack configuration file. As we discussed earlier the compiler we use for JS to compile is Babel
compiler.

npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-loader css-loader file-loader sass sass-loader webpack webpack-cli --save

create a file : webpack.config.js
in configuration,it contains number of JSON object. The different objects are output. devserver, module
