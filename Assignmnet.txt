Question 1 : Explain the need of the OS in a computer and what is kernel and shell?

Answer : Os is the Operating system which acts as the interface between the system software and hardware. There are different
types of OS available like Windows, Linux, Mac ect. Is allows you to communicate with the computer. Without OS a computer cannot operate. Every applications
run on a computer needs the OS support to run and perform the tasks given by the users. Kernel is the heart of the Operating system whereas shell
is a program. These are the two important components that work together to enable the use to interact with the system.
Shell allows the users to communicate with the Kernel. Kernel controls all the tasks of the system. Shell is the interface between the Kernel and User.
Kernel operates at a lower level than shell and interacts with hardware. Shell accepts commans from the user and Kernel receives the commans from shell.
